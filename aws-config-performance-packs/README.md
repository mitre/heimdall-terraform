# Important
> **Conformance packs provide a general-purpose compliance framework to help you create security, operational or cost-optimization governance checks using managed or custom AWS Config rules and AWS Config remediation actions. AWS conformance pack sample templates intend to help you create your own conformance packs with different or additional rules, input parameters and remediation actions that suit your environment. The sample templates, including those related to compliance standards and industry benchmarks, are not designed to ensure your compliance with a specific governance standard. They can neither replace your internal efforts nor guarantee that you will pass a compliance assessment.**
